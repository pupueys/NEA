# MTRX2700 C Lab
*by Nadeen, Ethan and Anikan
# Project Overview
The MTRX2700 C Lab is an application of the knowledge gained from MTRX2700 - Mechatronics 2. The various submodules in this repo demonstrate the functions of the STM32F3 microcontroller including GPIO, UART, hardware timers, etc. These submodules were integrated together to show all of these features working at once in a simple program. . All the tasks were coded using C programming language. This repository contains all the code we wrote, alongside the minutes of the meetings we had throughout the project. This readme should guide one through the process of using, testing, and understanding all code in our codebase. Our code was written with a focus on modularity, in order for integration to be easier at the end.

Everything was written for and intended for the STM32F3 Discovery Board which utilises the Cortex-M3 ARM processor, and as such, everything is intended for only such hardware.


# Modules and Submodules
## Digital Input Output (Digital IO)
## Serial Interface
For this section, `serial.c` and the corresponding `serial.h` was used as a baseline.
